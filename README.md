## Project 7: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. I then assessed its quality and tidiness, and then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
